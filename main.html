	<h1>Exploring Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of its input size. In other words, it helps us understand how the running time of an algorithm grows as the input data becomes larger. Efficient algorithms are those that exhibit low time complexity, meaning they complete their operations quickly even when faced with larger inputs. By analyzing time complexity, we can make informed decisions about selecting the most suitable algorithm for a particular problem, ensuring optimal performance for various scenarios.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis that focuses on the amount of memory or storage space an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It is often measured in terms of the additional memory used by the algorithm in relation to the size of the input. This concept becomes particularly significant when dealing with limited memory resources, such as in embedded systems or applications running on devices with constrained memory capacities. Algorithms with efficient space complexity, denoted as O(n) or other space-efficient notations, are designed to minimize the memory footprint while still producing accurate results. By evaluating space complexity, developers can make informed choices about memory utilization and select algorithms that best align with the available resources.</p>
